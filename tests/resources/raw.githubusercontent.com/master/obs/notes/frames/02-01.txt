**Adam** and his wife were very happy living in the beautiful **garden** **God** had made for them. Neither of them wore clothes, but this did not cause them to feel any **shame**, because there was no **sin** in the world. They often walked in the garden and **talked with God**. 

===== Important Terms: =====


  * **[[:en:obe:other:adam]]**
  * **[[:en:obe:kt:god]]**
  * **[[:en:obe:kt:sin]]**


==== Translation Notes: ====

  * **garden**  - A special collection of trees and plants that God prepared for Adam and Eve to enjoy and from which to eat. This should be the same word that was used in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-11|[01-11]]]**. See how you translated it there.
  * **talked with God**  - The word for "talk" should be the same as would be used to refer to talking to a human being. God may have taken a physical form to talk to the man and the woman since the text indicates that they talked to him face-to-face.
  * **shame**  - The feeling that comes with knowing we have sinned or that we fall short in some way.

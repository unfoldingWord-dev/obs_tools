After the two days had passed, **Jesus** said to his **disciples**, “Let’s go back to **Judea**.” “But **Teacher**,” the disciples answered, “Just a short time ago the people there wanted to kill you!” Jesus said, “Our friend **Lazarus has fallen asleep**, **and I must wake him**.”

  * **Judea** - This refers to the southern section of Israel, which was settled by the tribe of Judah. Some languages will prefer to say, "the region of Judea."
  * **has fallen asleep, and I must wake him.** - Translate this phrase with the normal words for "asleep" and "wake" in your language. Although Jesus was using these words with a different meaning, the disciples did not understand that yet.

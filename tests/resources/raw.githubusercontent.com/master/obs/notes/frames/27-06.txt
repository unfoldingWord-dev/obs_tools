===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues to tell the story.)
  * **happened to walk down** - That is, "happened to be traveling along." For some languages it may be necessary to use a word like "travel" rather than "walk" since the priest was not just walking on the road but was traveling to get to another city.
  * **ignored the man** - That is, "did not help the man" or, "showed no concern for the man."
  * **kept on going** - That is, "continued traveling down the road."

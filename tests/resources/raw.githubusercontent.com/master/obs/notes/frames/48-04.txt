**God promised** that one of **Eve's descendants** would **crush Satan's head**, and Satan would **wound his heel**. This meant that Satan would kill the **Messiah**, but God would **raise him to life again**, and then the Messiah will crush the power of Satan forever. Many years later, God revealed that **Jesus** is the Messiah.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **crush Satan's head** - This could also be translated as, "step on Satan's head and smash it down flat" or, "shatter Satan's head by stepping on it." This is an image of a person stepping on the head of a snake. The head is completely crushed, and the snake is dead and therefore harmless.
  * **wound his heel** - This is an image of a snake on the ground biting a person's foot. In this case, Satan would cause the Messiah to suffer, but would not destroy him.
  * **raise him to life again** - That is, "make him alive again."

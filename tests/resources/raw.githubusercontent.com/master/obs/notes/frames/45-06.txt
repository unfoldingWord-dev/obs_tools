A young man named **Saul** agreed with the people who killed Stephen and **guarded their robes** while they threw stones at him. That day, many people in **Jerusalem** started **persecuting** the followers of Jesus, so the **believers** fled to other places. **But in spite of this**, they **preached** about Jesus everywhere they went.

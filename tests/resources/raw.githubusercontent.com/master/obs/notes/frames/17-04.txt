**Saul** became jealous of the people's **love** for **David**. Saul tried many times to kill him, so David hid from Saul. **One day**, Saul was looking for David so he could kill him. Saul went into the same cave where David was hiding from Saul, but Saul did not see him. David was now very close to Saul and could have killed him, but he did not. Instead, David cut off a piece of Saul's clothes **to prove to Saul** that he would not kill him in order to become **king**.
